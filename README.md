# :rocket: Applied Data Science Capstone

This Capstone project represents the culmination of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) specialization, serving as the final course. It integrates and applies all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the specialization into a comprehensive project.

## :page_facing_up: Project Overview

SpaceX has revolutionized the commercial space industry, making space travel more affordable. The Falcon 9 rocket, which SpaceX promotes on its website, costs approximately $62 million per launch, significantly lower than other providers, which can cost upwards of $165 million. This cost reduction is largely due to SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Therefore, predicting whether the first stage will successfully land is crucial in estimating the overall cost of a launch. In this project, we utilize public data and machine learning models to predict the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage.

## :page_facing_up: Research Questions

- How do factors like payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbit type influence the success of the first stage landing?
- Has the success rate of landings improved over time?
- Which binary classification algorithm is most effective for this prediction task?

## :page_facing_up: Methodology

### 1. Data Collection

- Obtained data using the SpaceX REST API.
- Supplemented data with web scraping from Wikipedia.

### 2. Data Preparation

- Filtered and cleaned the data.
- Addressed missing values.
- Applied One-Hot Encoding to prepare data for binary classification.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted EDA using both visualization techniques and SQL queries.

### 4. Interactive Visual Analytics

- Created interactive visualizations using Folium and Plotly Dash.

### 5. Predictive Analysis

- Built, tuned, and evaluated various classification models to identify the best-performing algorithm.
